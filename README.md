# Assignment_5

## Part 1

In part one of this assignment I created a tool that allows the members of the credit union to see how their savings and investments are performing and whether they are meeting their financial goals or not.  I drew information about their holdings in both stocks and crypto currencies and compared that to their monthly income and if they had enough to have a comfortable emergency fund.

## Part 2

In part 2 of this assignment I created another tool that allowed the members of the credit union to see the potential risks and growth of their stock holdings for three different retirement timeframes.  First looking at a $20,000, 30 year investment and then looking at a $60,000 5 & 10 year investment into the SPY and the bond market.  All three simulations used the same 60/40 distribution of stocks to bonds.
